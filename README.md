### Learning Goals
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript
* Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively


### Abstract
* We used JavaScript to access and manipulate the DOM, adding interactive features and visual components, in conjunction with CSS and HTML. Also using Javascript, we created functionality that allows users to generate, save, and view random and user-generated motivational posters from data in a given set of arrays; to save and store thumbnail versions of the posters in an empty grid; and to switch among the main page view, create poster form view, and saved poster page view.


### Wins
* Worked extremely effectively as a team, following group norming agreement / DTR and following agreed-upon process for troubleshooting, updating norming agreements as needed
* Deepened our understanding of the Github workflow and learned to create more meaningful pull requests through each iteration of the project
* Effectively used Google Calendar as a time management tool to pre-plan and block out chunks of time throughout the week for each iteration of our project
* Learned to be resourceful utilizing our mentors, rocks, and independent research to troubleshoot and solve problems
* On the technical side, deepened our understanding of reading and writing code, how the DOM works, and using event listeners to create web page functionality
* Successfully wrong clean, DRY, organized JavaScript code with effective, compassionate variable and function names

### Challenges
* Time zone differences made scheduling slightly more difficult
* Newness of collaborative Github workflow was challenging at first, but both partners eventually gained confidence in using it effectively
* Being unfamiliar with the project scope and time requirements made it difficult for team members to anticipate the best way to format commit messages and branch names, but this improved with experience.
* The deleting posters function, Iteration 4, proved to be a challenge despite multiple attempts and independent research around event bubbling and propagation
